fix: add detailed error logging to firestore functions

This commit adds more detailed error logging to the Firestore functions for managing organization and volunteer feedback questions. Each function is now wrapped in a `try...catch` block that logs any potential errors to the console with a descriptive message before re-throwing the error. This will provide better visibility into any issues with Firestore interactions and help diagnose the problem of questions not being saved.
