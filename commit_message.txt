fix: add use client directive to staff organization page

This commit resolves a build error in `app/staff/organizations/page.tsx` by adding the `"use client"` directive. The page uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and the `Link` component from `next/link`, which require it to be a Client Component. Adding `"use client"` at the top of the file explicitly marks it as such, allowing these features to function correctly and resolving the build failure.
