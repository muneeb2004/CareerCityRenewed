fix: resolve final tailwindcss build error

This commit resolves a final build error related to Tailwind CSS. The error "Cannot apply unknown utility class `bg-gray-100`" indicated that the default Tailwind CSS utility classes were not being loaded.

The fix involves adding the `@import "tailwindcss";` directive back to the top of `app/globals.css`. This directive is required in Tailwind CSS v4 to inject the base, components, and utilities styles. The redundant `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;` directives were also removed.

This change ensures that all Tailwind CSS classes, including the default ones, are correctly loaded and applied, allowing the project to build successfully.
