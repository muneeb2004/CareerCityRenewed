fix: remove error handling to debug question creation

This commit temporarily removes the `try...catch...finally` blocks from the `handleAddQuestion` functions in the organization and volunteer question management pages. This is a debugging measure to expose any unhandled promise rejections that might be occurring during the Firestore write operations. By letting the errors surface in the browser console, it will be easier to diagnose why no response is being displayed when a new question is added.
