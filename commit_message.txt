clean: remove temporary commit_message.txt file

This commit removes the temporary `commit_message.txt` file from Git tracking. This file was created by the agent to store commit messages when the shell was unable to parse multiline commit messages directly. Since its purpose is fulfilled, it is now removed to maintain a clean working directory.
