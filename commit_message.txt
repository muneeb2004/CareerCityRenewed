debug: add nested try-catch to collection call

This commit adds a nested `try...catch` block around the `collection(db, 'collectionName')` calls within the `createOrganizationFeedbackQuestion` and `createVolunteerQuestion` functions. This is a debugging measure to pinpoint the exact location of a silent failure, as previous logs indicated the execution was stopping immediately after the Firestore instance was logged but before the collection reference was obtained.

The `collection` calls are now explicitly logged before execution, and any error encountered during their execution will be caught and logged with a specific message, providing more granular insight into whether the issue lies with obtaining the collection reference itself.
